# ToyCoin

ToyCoin is a basic cryptocurrency developed for the [Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency) class on Coursera.


## Overview

ToyCoin is a cryptocurrency based on distributed blockchains.

Each node validates and processes transactions from a pool of UTXOs. The validation steps include verifying digital signatures of the input coins with the senders' public keys.

This na√Øve implementation of a toy model does not include a mining puzzle of any form such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake.
